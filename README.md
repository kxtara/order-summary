## My process

I started with structuring my HTML, knowing that I'd need a
container to imitate the card, then proceeded to style it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to continue with FEM challenges and work more with CSS Grid.
